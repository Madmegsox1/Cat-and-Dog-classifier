## Cat and Dog image classifier

This takes an image and classifies it as a dog or a cat!

it uses over 4000 images of both cats and dogs.

### How to use it:
The model is already trained and automatically loads up the save file but if you want to train it your self just uncommet
the line's

The modules you need are:
`tensorflow` and `scipy` and `PIL` but the other libs should be pre-installed.

To see if an image is a cat or a dog put it into the folder called `working_set` then run the py file.
you should see an output like this:

_P.s this is my first opens source machine learning project so it isn't perfect lol, but let me know of any improvements I could make to my model!_
